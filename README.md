# Z-score System

This system is intended for school nutritionists who wish to record and monitor the z-score measurements of students aged 0 to 5 in the schools where they work.

## Z-score Measure

The z-score is a standardized measure that indicates the distance of a given value in relation to the mean of a reference population, this distance being expressed in multiples of the standard deviation, and may be positive or negative depending on whether the value is above or below the mean.

### Reference Standards

Institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO) provide weight references according to age. These references are structured in tables that present medians and standard deviations, differentiating children by age group and sex.

The reference standard tables used in this system only consider the age range corresponding to children aged 0 to 5 years and were obtained through the link indicated below.
